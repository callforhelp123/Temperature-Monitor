## Google Spreadsheet setup ## 
- Ensure Google account is a developer account
- Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a new project
- Click on the “+ Enable APIs and Services” button next to APIs & Services.
- Enter in the search bar “Google Sheets API” and select the resulting API that appears, then click the Enable button for the API Library.
- Go to Credentials in the left tab
- Create a new OAuth Client ID
- Select “Desktop App” as the application type
- Once created, download the OAuth Client using the download icon underneath “actions”
- This will download a .json file that you should rename to credentials.json
- Copy and paste this file in the main program folder (same as where main.py, README are)
- Create a Google Sheet where you want to store your data
- Find the unique ID of the Google Sheet (the random string of letters and numbers after /d/, so 121BrpHHTBJlJzvaev-grbtioXInxn9LMmwMZwZadjQM in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/121BrpHHTBJlJzvaev-grbtioXInxn9LMmwMZwZadjQM)
- Open main.py, and in the class Sheets_Logging, Copy and for the global variable SPREADSHEET_ID, replace the ID with the new unique ID


## Initial Setup / Running the Program ##
- In main.py, navigate to the class Temp_Controls
    - Here, adjust the user controlled variables as you see fit
- Contact an existing user for the password.py file (it is not included for security reasons on the repo)
- Ensure that the password.py file is in the same folder as the credentials.json folder
- In terminal, navigate to the program directory
- pip install -r requirements
- python main.py (<--- this runs the program until keyboard interrupt)
- If prompted with authorization sequence that uses terminal, let everything load into the Google API menu, then use the keyboard command to exit out.
- There should be an authorization URL that Google generated. Copy and paste that URL into a web browser and follow the instructions there.
- Hopefully it is working now... :thinkingemoji:
